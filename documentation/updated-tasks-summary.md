# Updated Tasks Summary - Hindi to English Book Translation System

## Overview
Successfully updated the task list based on the detailed PRD to use **Google Cloud Translation LLM** instead of Claude/OpenAI, with specific technical requirements and implementation details.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. Google Cloud Translation LLM Integration
- All tasks now reference Google's Translation LLM API
- Endpoint: `us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com`
- Model path: `projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/us-central1/models/general/translation-llm`
- Character limit: 9,000 (with 256 sentence maximum)
- Temperature: 0 (for consistency)

### 2. Enhanced Technical Specifications
- **PII Scrubbing**: Added regex patterns for phone numbers and emails
- **Cost Tracking**: $0.20 per 1000 characters with 70% budget alerts
- **Quality Metrics**: MQM defect scoring (≤3 per 1000 words), zero critical errors
- **Glossary Hit Rate**: ≥98% requirement
- **Back-translation similarity**: 0.85 cosine similarity threshold

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- API rate limiting (429) with exponential backoff
- Service unavailable (5xx) with 3 retries  
- Asyncio semaphore for quota management (10 concurrent requests)
- Network timeout handling

15. **Run MVP Test with First 3 Pages** (High Priority)
    - End-to-end validation
    - Cost monitoring (~$0.60 for 3 pages)
    - MQM defect checking
    - Line alignment verification

## Next Steps

1. **Set up API Keys**: To use task-master's AI features, you'll need to configure API keys in a `.env` file
2. **Start Implementation**: Begin with Task 1 (Google Cloud setup) and follow the dependency chain
3. **Use Manual Task Management**: Since the AI features require API keys, you can manually work through the tasks using the updated `tasks.json` file

## Technical Stack
- **Translation**: Google Cloud Translation LLM
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF (fitz) with pytesseract
- **Output**: python-docx for DOCX generation
- **Storage**: SQLite for translation memory
- **UI**: Streamlit for review dashboard
- **CLI**: Click framework
- **Quality**: spaCy, sentence-transformers for NLP analysis
