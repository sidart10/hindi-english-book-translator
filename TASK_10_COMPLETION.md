# Task 10: Quality Assurance System - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Quality Assurance System with MQM (Multidimensional Quality Metrics) defect scoring and back-translation similarity checks for the Hindi-English book translation system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core QA Module (`src/quality_assurance.py`)
- **QAConfig**: Configuration dataclass with all quality thresholds
- **QualityAssurance**: Main class implementing 8 comprehensive quality checks
- **MQM Scoring**: Weighted defect scoring system (critical=5, major=3, minor=1)
- **Report Generation**: Aggregated statistics and recommendations

### 2. Quality Checks Implemented

#### ✅ Length Ratio Validation
- Acceptable range: 0.8-1.5 ratio
- Prevents overly verbose or truncated translations

#### ✅ Glossary Hit Rate
- Target: ≥98% compliance
- Ensures cultural terms are translated consistently
- Supports multiple translation variants (e.g., "dharma/religion")

#### ✅ Back-Translation Similarity
- Uses NLLB-200 embeddings for semantic comparison
- Minimum cosine similarity: 0.85
- Detects potential meaning drift

#### ✅ MQM Defect Scoring
- Target: ≤3 defects per 1000 words
- Zero critical errors allowed
- Categorizes by severity levels

#### ✅ Number Consistency
- Ensures all numbers are preserved
- Validates decimal formats
- Critical for factual accuracy

#### ✅ Proper Noun Detection
- Identifies Hindi honorifics (श्री, जी)
- Pattern matching for common name formats
- Minimum consistency: 95%

#### ✅ Punctuation Preservation
- Maps Hindi sentence endings (।) to English (.)
- Preserves question marks and exclamations
- Validates sentence structure

#### ✅ Terminology Consistency
- Tracks repeated terms across document
- Ensures consistent translation choices
- Helps maintain coherence

### 3. Integration with Main Controller
- QA runs automatically on each translated sentence
- Results stored in `qa_result` field for each sentence
- Quality warnings added to output DOCX
- Overall statistics tracked and reported

### 4. Enhanced Output
- DOCX includes QA warnings with specific issues
- QA scores displayed for failed translations
- Top 3 issues shown inline, with count of additional issues

### 5. Configuration
Added comprehensive quality settings to config.json:
```json
"quality": {
    "min_confidence": 0.85,
    "min_length_ratio": 0.8,
    "max_length_ratio": 1.5,
    "min_glossary_hit_rate": 0.98,
    "min_cosine_similarity": 0.85,
    "max_mqm_defects_per_1000": 3,
    "max_critical_errors": 0
}
```

### 6. Dependencies Added
- `spacy>=3.7.0` - For NLP analysis
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - For numerical operations
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0` - For NLLB embeddings

### 7. Testing & Demonstration
- Created `test_quality_assurance.py` for comprehensive testing
- Created `demo_quality_assurance.py` for simple demonstration
- Created `install_spacy_models.py` for model setup

## Key Features

### Professional Quality Standards
- MQM-based scoring aligns with industry standards
- Objective, measurable quality metrics
- Actionable feedback for improvements

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Preserves Hindi honorifics and cultural terms
- Glossary ensures consistent terminology
- Supports multiple valid translations

### Comprehensive Coverage
- 8 different quality dimensions checked
- Both linguistic and technical accuracy
- Semantic preservation verified

### Integration Benefits
- Automatic quality control during translation
- Early detection of issues
- Detailed reporting for analysis

## Next Steps
With Task 10 complete, the system now has professional-grade quality assurance. This enables:
- Confident translation of production books
- Quality metrics for client reporting  
- Continuous improvement through QA feedback
- Foundation for Task 11 (Review Dashboard) with QA data
